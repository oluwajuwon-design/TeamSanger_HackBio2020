# Help
To execute the scripts from this repository, a general script is provided that contains information on cloning the repository itself. Using *git clone* followed by the link to the repository allows you to clone. Upon cloning, it will provides command to change the directory from the current repository to the Team_Sanger Repository. To execute the scripts, you need to add rights to execute which can be achieved by *chmod +x script*. A for loop is provided that helps loop through each and every script and execute as per the commands within the loop. 

**Note**
You need to install all the softwares listed above for the scripts to be executed. 
In case you bump into an error of **bad interpreter** when executing the scripts. Check the location of your software using this the example command as shown below:

```
# For example
which R
/usr/local/bin/R

which python3
/usr/local/bin/python3

which perl
/usr/local/bin/perl

which ruby
/usr/bin/ruby

which php
/usr/bin/php

# Remember your location may vary ! Whatever the location is just add it to the title.
```

On your terminal. Having found the path to either the compiler or interpreter then check the shebang (e.g #!/usr/local/bin/bash) of the individual script and edit it to suit your local machine.
